# Module-20-Self-Assessment

# Self-Assessment
> I was able to complete project on time with some challenges, mostly used course contents but dug further to overcome database connectivity and interactive web page designing steps. Each team member tried his/her best to contribute project deliverable. Though existing work schedule and sickness were biggest hinders in the middle of project. Somehow, assuming no other choice I kept myself and team on the track by sharing responsibilities. We were able to identify skillsets of each team member and distributed project phases accordingly. I was able to learn lots of new topic e.g. Python, R, Maching learining, GitHub and tried to utilize all those within my project.
> * Finally, we made it! 

# Team Assessment:
> My team members dedicated time and efforts to ensure on time project delivery. During project and team skillsets assessment, we distributed roles with no conflicts. No one hesitated to raise hand for any potential road blocker. We worked together like a pro to keep project deliverables on track by following Rubric guidelines. Not only we coordinated timely, we also provided helping hands to each other when two team members got Covid in the middle of project. Most of the coding we completed together thru virtual meetins to ensure not glitch and right outputs. Also, this given us opportunity to learn new logics and effecient coding flow.    

# Summary of Project: 
> “Mental Health and the Covid-19 Pandemic” was the topic of our project, due ongoing health crises, we decided to implement a comprehensive data analysis program on the soaring pandemic effects related to mental health in past 2 years. In order to perform interactive real-time data analysis, we imported a large surveyor based data that was conducted in all-across America by a reputed organization CDC “Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (www.CDC.gov).
For all project related collaboration and hosting, project team members were connected through Slack, Git-hub and zoom meetings.
We decided on using a supervised tree model for our machine learning. The most important reason we chose this model is because of how easy it is to rank feature importance. Our goal was to find out what factors were major contributors to mental health disorders during the pandemic and using this model allowed us to do just that. It doesn't give us the highest accuracy compared to other models. But given the data we had access to we decided it was better to have access to feature rankings.

* The final trained accuracy was around 60%.
